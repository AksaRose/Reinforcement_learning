# üÉè Reinforcement Learning ‚Äì Blackjack Agent

This project demonstrates the fundamentals of **Reinforcement Learning (RL)** by training an agent to play **Blackjack**, using **Gymnasium** (formerly OpenAI Gym).

The goal is to teach an agent to make optimal decisions ‚Äî whether to ‚Äúhit‚Äù or ‚Äústick‚Äù ‚Äî to maximize its expected reward in a simulated Blackjack environment.

## üìò Project Overview

Blackjack is a simple card game where the player competes against the dealer.  
This project implements a **Monte Carlo Exploring Starts (MC-ES)** algorithm to estimate value functions and derive an optimal strategy for the **Blackjack-v1** environment.

The environment models the full game dynamics, including card draws, busts, wins, and losses. The agent learns entirely through simulation and feedback ‚Äî no prior knowledge of Blackjack rules is required.
